# CUDA File Encryptor

This project began as an effort to encrypt large video files (10â€“15 GB) in parallel. As the implementation progressed, the focus shifted toward understanding the AES encryption algorithm in depth and achieving measurable performance improvements over traditional CPU-based encryption.

This repository contains a CUDA-based AES encryption system designed to efficiently process files in parallel. The encryption kernel operates on 128-bit blocks, utilizing the GPU's parallel processing capabilities to accelerate encryption.

## Performance

This implementation demonstrates a **~6000% speedup** over sequential CPU-based AES encryption for input files **larger than 5 MB**. For smaller files, GPU kernel launch overhead limits the performance benefit, but for large file sizes, GPU parallelism provides a significant throughput advantage.

## Features

- CUDA-accelerated AES encryption for efficient file processing  
- Block-based encryption (128-bit block size) suitable for large files  
- Padding support to ensure consistent encryption for files of arbitrary size  

## Requirements

- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit  
- C++ compiler with CUDA support (e.g., `nvcc`)  

## Future Work

- Add support for AES-192 and AES-256 key sizes  
- Implement a mechanism similar to AES-CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) for enhanced security  
- Optimize memory usage through local/shared memory  
- Investigate additional CUDA-specific optimizations
